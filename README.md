## Database Q&A

## Database Used

mongoDB - a document based NoSQL Database

## Database Considered

mongoDB - a document based NoSQL Database
MySQL - most popular Relational Database

## Reasons for selecting mongoDB

Development phase - It is easy to work with mongoDB while in development because of its less restrictive nature.
Flexble Schema - NoSQL doesn't follow any schema. Therefore we can just push data without thinking about the schema.
Scalability - Not considered this factor for this project but mongoDB has proved itself in the tests of scalabilty.
